			<h3>A Very Brief History</h3>
			<article>
				<p>Aaron Swartz was an American programmer and activist. He pushed for open access to information, in his <a href="https://archive.org/details/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/page/n1/mode/2up" title="Guerilla Open Access Manifesto">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a> he urged those with access to information to copy and share said information. He also urged everyone to take information and save, copy, and redistribute, and fight for Guerilla Open Access.</p>
				<p>Aaron attended Stanford University but dropped out after one year. Despite this he still had an impact on the internet, he created web.py because he was unhappy with current web applications frameworks. Aaron also helped the creation of reddit, the 6th most visited site in the US, when his company Infogami merged with Reddit in its early days. </p>
				<p>Unfortunately, Aaronâ€™s yearning for open access to information landed him in legal trouble. Aaron had access to JSTOR, a digital repository of academic material, he accessed JSTOR from MIT as they had an open campus policy. He downloaded a large amount of papers from JSTOR before the MIT access was blocked from JSTOR.</p>
				<p>Although Aaron had free and legal access to JSTOR, he was charged with wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer. A little over a year later 9 more felony counts were brought against him also. Aaron was offered 6 months in a low security prison if he pleaded guilty to 13 federal crimes, but he rejected this. A few months later Aaron dies of suicided on January 11, 2013.</p>
